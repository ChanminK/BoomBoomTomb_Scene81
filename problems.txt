In explorer text(first time):
    Welcome adventurer! You are now at the famous Boom Boom Tomb!
    Here, you must find three special artifacts and bring them back to me!
    But be careful! If you're not careful, you might go...
    BOOOM - bigboom.mp3 plays
    If you don't want to,
    GET OUT - get out sfx plays, image switches to get out png
    (also don't reload the page progress might reset)

    So adventurer, what would you like to do?
    (two options show up: adventure, leave)
    
    press leave:
    alright
    GET OUT - get out mp3 plays, choose between the three other scenes connected and force user to go three

    press adventure:
    Wonderful!
    Here's how it works: when you enter the tomb, you will be presented with 3 doors.
    Choose one and hope that it isn't a bomb!
    You might find artifacts, treasures, or coins to spend at the shop to help you!
    Continue and when you have 3 artifacts, come back to me!
    Then I'll give you your pize.
    Good luck!

Explorer(after this)
    Now the tomb is a dangerous place, but remember this!
    You might hear some telltale signs of certain things!

    Conversation options:
    I have all the artifacts
        If its true:
            Wonderful!
            Here's your prize:
            after you press enter rickroll starts playing on screen
        If it's false:
            Hmm, you don't seem to have three artifacts yet...
            come back later!

    when you click each door you have a chance to hear something
    but 1/2 chance you do or it says "you can't hear anything"
